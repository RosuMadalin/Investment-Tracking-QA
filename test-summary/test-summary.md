# Test Summary Report

**Project:** Investment Tracker – QA Testing Project
**Application under test:** https://rosumadalin.github.io/tracking-tradings/#
**Testing period:** August 2026
**Tester:** Madalin Rosu

## Scope
Manual functional, UI, validation, negative, regression and basic compatibility testing of the watchlist, charting, navigation and news features, per `../test-plan/test-plan.md`. Performance, security and test automation were explicitly out of scope for this phase.

## Key Findings
- The "Select range" dropdown on the Charts view is not wired to any event handler — selecting a different range never reloads the chart with new data ([BUG-001](../bug-reports/BUG-001.md)).
- Core watchlist operations (add, duplicate/empty/invalid validation, delete, persistence after refresh) all behave correctly.
- Chart rendering and browser resizing behave correctly and consistently between Chrome and Firefox.
- Navigation between Home and Charts correctly shows/hides the relevant sections.
- The Portfolio, News, Wallet and Settings navbar links (besides the dedicated Home/Charts flows) have no click behavior implemented — acceptable for this stage, since these areas are not yet built out, but worth tracking as scope grows.

## Recommendation
No blocking defects were found. **BUG-001** should be fixed before the range selector is presented to real users, since it is a visible control that currently does nothing — but it does not affect the core watchlist/chart/news functionality, which is otherwise stable.

## Next Steps
- Fix BUG-001, retest TC-09, run a regression pass on the directly related cases (TC-08, TC-09)
- Expand test-cases as Portfolio/Wallet/Settings become functional
- Optional: add API-level testing for the RapidAPI endpoints the app depends on (`../api-testing/`)
