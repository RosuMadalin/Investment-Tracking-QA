# Investment Tracker – QA Portfolio Project

Manual QA portfolio project built around **Investment Tracker**, a live stock watchlist/charting web app.

- **Application under test (AUT):** https://rosumadalin.github.io/tracking-tradings/#
- **Source code of the app:** https://github.com/RosuMadalin/tracking-tradings
- **Role demonstrated:** Manual/Junior QA — test planning, test case design, test execution, defect reporting, regression testing.

## Bug tracking

Defects found during execution are logged as markdown files in `bug-reports/`, then mirrored into a Jira project (`Investment Tracking-QA`) for workflow tracking, with a custom `Severity` field alongside the built-in `Priority`.

- Board: To Do → In Progress → Ready for Test → In Testing → Failed → Passed → Done
- BUG-001 is tracked as **ITQ-2**, currently in `Failed` — see `screenshots/jira-board.png` and `screenshots/jira-BUG-001.png`

This repo, not the Jira account, is what's shared with employers — Jira is used and evidenced here through screenshots, not linked directly.
